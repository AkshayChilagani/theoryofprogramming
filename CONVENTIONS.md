* Your file name (or public class name in languages like Java, C#) must be the name of the algorithm or the data structure.
* For languages like C, your method names and variable names must follow [Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) naming convention (starts with lower case). For other languages like Java (follow Camel case for methods and variables, Pascal case for classes) or Python (follow the underscore separation style) etc., please follow the language recommended naming convention.
* Your code must be fully indented. You may follow [any indentation style](http://theoryofprogramming.com/2016/11/14/writing-professional-code-c/). Make sure your code is absolutely legible and elegant.
* Your code must be well commented. It is generally recommended to have at least one line of comment for every 3-5 lines of code. Comments must explain any complex logic or various cases.
* Avoid using unnecessary variables.
* Please use proper variable names.
* Please use the minimum possible scope for your variables.
